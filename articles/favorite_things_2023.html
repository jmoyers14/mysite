<h1>My Favorite Things 2023</h1>
<p>
    For my first post I want to reflect on the 2023 by compiling a list of my
    favorite things. There’s no particular theme; They are just things I like
    that I want to remember and share. This is inspired by my friend Rick’s
    fantastic article from 2022. I hopy you write another :)

    <b>Day: October 20, 2023</b>
    <br />
    The best day of my life thus far – the day I married my beautiful, kind, and
    hilarious wife, Nona. It was a culmination of many wonderful moments: the
    relief of concluding our wedding planning, the warmth of love from our
    friends and family, and the excitement of embarking on a new chapter in my
    life.

    <b>Podcast: Matt & Shane’s Secret Podcast</b>
    <br />
    Listeners of the Joe Rogan Podcast are probably familiar with Shane Gillis’s
    explosion in popularity throughout 2020s. His podcast, “Matt & Shane’s
    Secrect Podcast”, which led to his firing from SNL in 2019, grew to become
    the #1 podcast on Patreon in 2023. Shane, along with co-host Matt McCusker
    offers a fresh persptive in a comedy landscape largely influenced by Los
    Angeles and New York comedians. Regularly featuring guests from the
    Philadelphia comedy circuit, it's exciting to see which of these new
    comedians will rise to prominence through MSSP, similar to the way many have
    gained fame from appearances on Joe Rogan's podcast.

    <b>Brewery: Pfriem</b>
    <br />
    During the two years I've been with TrovaTrip, I've had the opportunity to
    visit Portland, Oregon eight times. Portland excels in craft beer, and
    whenever I'm in town, I make sure to enjoy some of the exceptional West
    Coast-style IPAs from pFriem. Amidst the rising popularity of hazy IPAs,
    it's refreshing to find breweries that still deliver beers that blast your
    face off with hops like pFriem. Should you come across their beers on tap, I
    highly recommend giving them a try.
