            <h1>My Favorite Things 2023</h1>
            <p>
                I compiled this list of my favorite things as way to reflect on
                the year 2023. There's no overarching theme; each item has
                impacted me in one way or another, and I wish to share and
                preserve these memories as my way of remembering the year. This
                was inspired by my friend Rick's

                <b>Day: October 20, 2023</b>
                <br />
                The best day of my life thus far – the day I married my
                beautiful, kind, and hilarious wife, Nona. It was a culmination
                of many wonderful moments: the relief of concluding our wedding
                planning, the warmth of love from our friends and family, and
                the excitement of embarking on a new chapter in my life.

                <b>YouTube: Caleb Hammer's Financial Audit</b>
                <br />
                Nona and I are drawn to Financial Audits the same way passing
                drivers are captivated by a car wreck. For each guest, Caleb
                reviews one month of their personal finanical statements and
                helps them build a budget to payoff their dept or meet whatever
                financial goal they may have. Caleb navigates each session
                skillfully with enthusiasm and empathy, while compelling the
                guests to confront the realities of their financial situations.
                While Nona and I are not in as dire straits as many of Caleb's
                guests, the series has helped us to examine our own spending and
                develop better financial plans so we don't "end up dying on the
                walmart floor".

                <br />
                Living just two miles from the coast, visiting Ocean Beach has
                become an part of my morning routine. Every morning, I load Bill
                and my surfboard into my 4Runner and head to the beach. After a
                short but sometimes relaxplaying and occasionally terrifying
                surf session, I take Bill to play with his friends at the dog
                beach. I've compiled a video featuring about a second from every
                visit we made to Ocean Beach in 2023.

                <b>Podcast: Matt & Shane’s Secret Podcast</b>
                <br />
                With some 4 million podcasts in existance most podcasters have
                little hope of ever breaking into the top 100, especially if the
                schtick is “we’re comedians talking about stuff”. Yet something
                about Matt and Shanes Secret Podcast resonated enough to reach
                the #1 spot on Patreon. Shane and co-host Matt McCusker offers a
                new persptive in a comedy landscape largely influenced by Los
                Angeles and New York comedians. Regularly featuring guests from
                the Philadelphia comedy scene, it's fun to watch new comedians
                rise to prominence, similar to how many comedians gained fame
                from Joe Rogan's podcast.

                <b>Place: Maui</b>
                <br />
                We visited Maui just two months before the island would
                withstand 'the worst natural disaster' in the history of Hawaii.
                A series of wind-driven wildfires led to widespread damage and
                killed at least 100 people. We stayed with our friends Hayden
                and Ana at their condo in Māʻalaea Bay, north of Kihei and south
                of Lahaina. I still have a hard time believing the town of
                Lahaina is completely destroyed.
                <br /><br />
                Despite the impending disaster, our time in Maui was filled with
                unforgettable moments. We hiked to waterfalls, snorkeled with
                turtles, and enjoyed some amazing sunsets. Surfing here was a
                bit different compared to California. The water was cleaner and
                warmer, but the waves broke mostly over shallow reef. A local
                taught me the importance of 'falling flat' to avoid getting
                scraped up by the reef, a precaution not typically needed at a
                beach break in San Diego. We eagerly look forward to returning
                to Maui once it has recovered.

                <b>Brewery: pFriem</b>
                <br />
                During the two years I've been with TrovaTrip, I've had the
                opportunity to visit Portland, Oregon eight times. Portland
                excels in craft beer, and whenever I'm in town, I make sure to a
                West Coast-style IPA from pFriem. Amidst the rising popularity
                of hazy IPAs, it's refreshing to find breweries that still brew
                IPAs that just blast your face off with hops. Should you come
                across their beers on tap (and you like that sorta thing), I
                highly recommend giving it a try.

                <b>Album: One More Time by Blink 182</b>
                <br />
                Blink-182 has been my favorite band since I first statred
                discovering music. I’ve always felt a connection to Blink-182
                becuase they originated in my home town of Poway. So when I
                heard that they were releasing their first album in eight years
                with all three original members on my wedding day, it felt
                somewhat natural. As an album, One More Time really delivers.
                With its massive-sounding power chords, upbeat melodies, teenage
                angst and sophomoric humor, it's everything you could want from
                a Blink album.

                <b>Technology: Chat GPT</b>
                <br />
                It's hard for me to imagine life before Google Search, and I
                believe that in 10 years, it'll be just as challenging to remember 
                life before GPTs. It’s pretty wild to watch a computer program
                write code based off a description I gave it. Or even better,
                watch a computer program write a description based off code I
                give it. ChatGPT is a great tool for rapidly prototyping various
                ideas. Regular requests like 'Write tests for this', 'Document
                this', or 'Explain this configuration file’ are common in my
                workflow. It's a mix of awe and apprehension to see the
                direction technology is taking.
