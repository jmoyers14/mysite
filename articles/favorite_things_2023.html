            <h1>My Favorite Things 2023</h1>
            <p>
                For my first post I want to reflect on the 2023 by compiling a
                list of my favorite things. There’s no particular theme; They
                are just things I like that I want to remember and share. This
                is inspired by my friend Rick’s fantastic
                <a

                <b>Day: October 20, 2023</b>
                <br />
                The best day of my life thus far – the day I married my
                beautiful, kind, and hilarious wife, Nona. It was a culmination
                of many wonderful moments: the relief of concluding our wedding
                planning, the warmth of love from our friends and family, and
                the excitement of embarking on a new chapter in my life.

                <b>YouTube: Caleb Hammer's Financial Audit</b>
                <br />
                Nona and I are drawn to Financial Audits in the same way drivers
                are captivated by a car wreck on the freeway. For each guest
                Caleb reviews one month of their personal finanical statements
                and helps them build a budget to payoff their dept or meet
                whatever financial goal they may have. Caleb navigates each
                session skillfully with enthusiasm and empathy, while compelling
                the guests to confront the realities of their financial
                situations. While Nona and I are not in as dire straits as many
                of Caleb's guests, the series has helped us to examine our own
                spending and develop better financial plans and habits heading
                into 2024.

                <b>Beach: Ocean Beach</b>
                <br />
                Living just two miles from the coast, visiting Ocean Beach has
                become an part of my morning routine. Every morning, I load Bill
                and my surfboard into my 4Runner and head to the beach. After a
                short but sometimes relaxplaying and occasionally terrifying
                surf session, I take Bill to play with his friends at the dog
                beach. I've compiled a video featuring about a second from every
                visit we made to Ocean Beach in 2023.

                <b>Podcast: Matt & Shane’s Secret Podcast</b>
                <br />
                Listeners of the Joe Rogan Podcast are probably familiar with
                Shane Gillis’s explosion in popularity throughout 2020s. You
                might think there enough room in the podcast space for another
                podcast where comedians sit around and talk but “Matt & Shane’s
                Secrect Podcast” grew to become the #1 podcast on Patreon in
                2023. Shane, along with co-host Matt McCusker offers a fresh
                persptive in a comedy landscape largely influenced by Los
                Angeles and New York comedians. Regularly featuring guests from
                the Philadelphia comedy circuit, it's exciting to see which of
                these new comedians will rise to prominence through MSSP,
                similar to the way many have gained fame from appearances on Joe
                Rogan's podcast.

                <b>Brewery: pFriem</b>
                <br />
                During the two years I've been with TrovaTrip, I've had the
                opportunity to visit Portland, Oregon eight times. Portland
                excels in craft beer, and whenever I'm in town, I make sure to
                enjoy some of the West Coast-style IPAs from pFriem. Amidst the
                rising popularity of hazy IPAs, it's refreshing to find
                breweries that still deliver beers that blast your face off with
                hops like pFriem. Should you come across their beers on tap, I
                highly recommend giving them a try.
